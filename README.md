# 📐 Math & Sound Visualization Library

A collection of interactive mathematical and auditory visualizations.

## 🚀 Projects

This repository contains three main visualization applications:

1.  **[Math Sound Visualizer](./math-sound/)**: Explore the intersection of mathematical functions and sound. (Basic, Curves, Art, Synth, Math, and Bytebeat). Includes a live MIDI mixer and random playback sequences.
2.  **[Polygon Sound](./polygon-sound/)**: Visualizing sound through polygonal geometry and harmonic relationships.
3.  **[General Visualization](./visualization/)**: A framework for various interactive data and mathematical visualizations.

## 🛠️ Local Development

To run all applications locally:

1.  Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2.  Run the server using the provided script:
    ```bash
    ./server.sh
    ```
3.  Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 📂 Directory Structure
